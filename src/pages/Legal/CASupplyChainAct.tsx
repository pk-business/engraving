      <h1>California Transparency in Supply Chains Act</h1>
      <p className="last-updated">Last Updated: January 11, 2026</p>

      <p>
        The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires retail sellers and manufacturers
        doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their
        direct supply chains. CustomCraft is committed to conducting business ethically and responsibly, and we are
        dedicated to ensuring that slavery and human trafficking are not present in our supply chain.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        CustomCraft is committed to ethical sourcing and manufacturing practices. We believe that all workers in our
        supply chain should be treated with dignity and respect, work in safe conditions, and receive fair compensation.
        We have zero tolerance for slavery, human trafficking, forced labor, and child labor in any form.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Verification of Product Supply Chains</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Risk Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        We conduct regular risk assessments of our supply chain to identify potential areas of concern related to human
